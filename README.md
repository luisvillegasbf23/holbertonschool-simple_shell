# **Simple Shell Project**

## **Introduction to Project:**
This simple shell project its a collaboration between Luis Baute and Rodrigo Olivera, two computer software engineering students.
This repository contains every file required to make this projects possible. Which consists of developing our own UNIX command interpreter (Simple Shell).


## What is a Shell
A **shell** is a software interface that's often a command line interface that enables the user to interact with the computer.
 
## About our Project
The aim of this project, presented to every group of Cohort 18 is to face and learn how the real shell works, by facing the creation of its simple version and also using some of our own created functions.
